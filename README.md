# ME 235 — Graduate Design of Microprocessor-Based Mechanical Systems  
**UC Berkeley · Department of Mechanical Engineering · Spring 2026**

## Course Overview
ME 235 prepares students to design and prototype mechanical systems that use microprocessors to control machines, acquire and analyze data, and interact with users. The course connects microprocessor architecture with electromechanical systems through hands-on laboratory exercises and software development.

Students gain practical experience integrating embedded systems, sensors, actuators, and control methods into working mechanical prototypes.
